The existing collective of the current Philly City Museum would be moved there but expanding access to Philly history current in the library's collection of maps throughout Philly's past would be the main taking-off point. I can imagine 3D reality presentations based on old maps.  A guest might walk in a //holodeck// style of 1700's reality with fewer bldgs, etc.

Philadelphia was the nations 1st capital city.  We don't see that well enough today or see what was here before that.

As the museum expanding into the space the library can expand as well.  The Rizzo statue could move to this new museum.  The city would have a notably better role in telling the nation's history +the role + betrayal of native Americans could be presented in a way that would have a chance to occasion some healing.","Education, History, Human Rights, Neighborhoods, Philadelphia, Politics, Social Justice",Museum,"Museum, library, city, history, Rizzo, Frank Rizzo, Native American, healing, maps",MR Meng,,,,MP192,Philadelphia,WEST MT.

Colorful LED lights are embedded all over it. Close to its base are 5 hand cranks of different sizes - some at heights children can use - and easy to turn. As you turn one, some of the lights begin to flicker on.
As the second one is turned, more lights are activated. As each additional crank is turned still more lights come alive - in patterns that multiply their playful effects.
When all 5 are being cranked, the total effect is particularly dramatic, variable, and exuberant. Examples (on the sphere) might be: an image of a turning globe, floating clouds, a waving flag, brilliant //fireworks//, or crazy curlicues. Once activated, it all stays lighted up for a few minutes.
It takes everyone, acting together, to ignite something spectacular.

Do people understand that monuments (statues) were erected in memory/honor of people who were important at that time? Do people understand the history that elevated people to a place where some felt a monument necessary?
My problem is not with monuments but with our failure to adequately teach the history surrounding a monument, to learn from that history and for individuals to emulate the qualities that allowed those individuals to rise up. Why have monuments if we fail to teach their significance? Or fail to apply lessons learned to our current knowledge to make a better history for us all.

The project involved high school students partnering with architects and graphic designers to come up with an idea for the use of the hundreds of vacant lots in Philadelphia, specifically in the Kensington area. Winners received $2000 to use on one lot to make their project a reality. My project was called //Tag You're It//, and it was about graffiti. I wanted to turn my lot into a blank white canvas, all walls completely white, the lot completely clean no longer filled with drug needles, broken bottles, overgrown weeds. The lot would be created for ALL local graffiti artists, youth, anyone at all, and they'd be able to graffiti, doodle, marker whatever they wanted on the wall. Too many young artists aren't able to freely express themselves because graffiti isn't considered art. It was given this negative connotation because often these artists have nowhere to put their art without it being considered illegal. I want to change that connotation. Art is expression for each and every individual, and they deserve this free space to express themselves. I was the winner of the project, but the company was put out of business before I could make my project a reality. It's something I will never stop feeling strongly about and I would love to see it happen and begin to change our neighborhoods.","Art, Neighborhoods, Youth","Interactive, Vacant Lot, Graffiti",,,,,,,Philadelphia,FRANKFORD

I could have actually walked to the river but drove past it on Delaware/Columbus Avenues and crossed it for pretty much 4 decades over the Walt, Ben, and Betsey predominantly going to work in NJ but also on Sundays going to my 4 favorite farmers for veggies when they were open for the season.

I'm very, very, very newly retired. I have newly discovered both the Delaware in a ver different sense and rediscovered the Center City where I went to High School, University City where I went to College and some Post-Grad and North Philly where I did some Post-Grad.

Among the asphalt, concrete, high rise towers, busses, etc., and the hordes of people, I would nominate something that can reconnect us to nature. The river itself has a nature that's there but that we may not see. The river can be placid and silken, it can look like there are diamonds on the water, it can seem to flow North or South depending on the winds, sometimes there are whitecaps. Sometimes the color changes right before your eyes depending on depth. It all depends on what Mother Nature decides.

But Mother Nature also sends ducks, geese, sparrows, wrens, pigeons, crows, seagulls, an occasional hawk, and squirrels (who may be demanding). But isn't that's what we're here for.

The footprint of the arch site is small enough to allow for construction around it, when that day comes. Overlaying the arch opens up new ideas in 21st century monument making. Ideas include: colorful ceramic tiles and the use of the state's sea; special lighting effects; sculpted art depictions as seen on the walls of the Museum of the Revolutionary; and much more - for this is a monument where art and architecture would truly work together.
Unlike war memorials, the Keystone State Arch is not about somberness, but rather celebration. Its location is viewed by thousands of visitors daily, and is sure to be a tourist stop and contribute to a new waterfront identity. Funding can come from a multitude of private and public resources, even including souvenirs.
Out of town planners may not give a damn about defining this stat's rich historical heritage with our own Arc de Triomphe, where Penn's vision was born, but some us do. This Monument Lab will be our last chance to have a monument at Penn's Landing worth of this great space. Once the nearly fifty foot concrete skeletal stfucture is torn down, this promising icon - worth of a world of tourists - will be lost forever. Don't let it happen.
Add your voice, your art, your texting fingers, your joy at seeing this great arch welcome you to Penn's Landing, even as it welcomes you now. For this memorial arch is long overdue; think of the Gateway in St. Louis, or even the Statue of Liberty in New York. Let us honor the dead as we create this lasting tribute and invest in the future of our great Delaware River waterfront.","Architecture, Art, Culture, History, Philadelphia","Infrastructure, Mural, Space",,Mitchell Gordon,,,,CH131,Philadelphia,MARKET EAST

However, I also think that the universities represent a huge divide. University City sometimes feels like a bubble for students who don't always venture out. Additionally, while Philadelphia has a huge population of college students, only about 25% of Philadelphians graduate from college. The railway bridge near World Cafe Live has a really interesting aesthetic because of how the ivy grows up the sides. I propose to put vine arbors underneath on Walnut Street to make use of this natural decoration and to make the bridge to University City more inviting. This might cause college students to venture and learn more about the city, and invite more citizens into University City to make it feel less like an enclosed place.",,,,,,,,,Radnor,
